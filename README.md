# ER-Games

# 1. ASK Phase (Defining the Problem & Business Goals)

## 1.1: Key Questions to Answer
- How can ER Games align its new puzzle-RPG hybrid game with current industry trends?
- Besides the US, which international markets should ER Games focus on?
- How do changing consumer preferences and demographics influence ER Games' marketing and sales strategy?

## 1.2: Business Context
ER Games is a small company competing against larger RPG game studios. They have released a demo to test consumer interest and identify target demographics. Founder’s View: Market the game outside the US first (especially in Japan & Europe). Consultant’s View: Launch globally without a phased approach.

## 1.3: Stakeholders
- James Spier: ER Games founder

# 2. PREPARE Phase (Collecting & Understanding the Data)

## 2.1 Data Sources:
Console Data (Game Sales & Reviews)

Game information: 
- Name, platform, genre, developer, publisher, release year.
- Sales data: NA, Europe, Japan, and Other regions.
- User & critic reviews: Ratings & number of reviews.
- ESRB ratings: Audience appropriateness.
- Population Data (Market Size & Trends)

Population statistics (1995-2017) for different countries.
- Country Name: name of the country
- Country code: code of the country used in public data
- All other variables from 1995 to 2017: population of country in that year

## 2.2: Data Credibility and ROCCC Assessment

I will use ROCCC to assess whether this data has issues with bias or credibility.

- **Reliable**: Sales data is likely accurate, but critic & user reviews may contain bias or gaps. Population data is reliable if sourced from reputable databases.
- **Original**: The console data comes from a third-party source (likely a gaming database or review aggregator). The population data is from a public dataset (likely a government or UN source). The credibility depends on the reputation of these sources.
- **Comprehensive**: Game data is detailed (genre, platform, sales, reviews), but user demographics are missing. Population data lacks breakdowns like age groups or gaming habits.
- **Current**: No, the data is not current. Population data stops at 2017 (not fully up-to-date). Game data’s relevance depends on its last update—if recent, it’s useful; if outdated, trends may not align with 2025 market dynamics.
- **Cited**: Not explicitly mentioned. We need to verify the sources of the datasets.

# 3: PROCESS

In the process phase, we ensure our data is clean by correcting or removing inaccurate, corrupted, improperly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete entries within the dataset.

## 3.1: Reviewing Our Data in Excel
We open your worksheet to review headers, data types, and any obvious issues such as extra spaces or misformatted dates. We also adjust column sizes to ensure clear visibility of the data. Additionally, locking the header columns keeps the column labels visible while scrolling horizontally through a large dataset, making it easier to identify which data corresponds to each column (View -> Freeze First Column).
### 3.1.1: Quick Filtering
We want to quickly filter our data to check for any NULL, 'NA', or 0 values. Use Data → Filter to review unique values and identify any irregularities in each column.
