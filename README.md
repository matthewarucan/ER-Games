# ER-Games

# 1. ASK Phase (Defining the Problem & Business Goals)

## 1.1: Key Questions to Answer
- How can ER Games align its new puzzle-RPG hybrid game with current industry trends?
- Besides the US, which international markets should ER Games focus on?
- How do changing consumer preferences and demographics influence ER Games' marketing and sales strategy?

## 1.2: Business Context
ER Games is a small company competing against larger RPG game studios. They have released a demo to test consumer interest and identify target demographics. Founder’s View: Market the game outside the US first (especially in Japan & Europe). Consultant’s View: Launch globally without a phased approach.

## 1.3: Stakeholders
- James Spier: ER Games founder

# 2. PREPARE Phase (Collecting & Understanding the Data)

## 2.1 Data Sources:
Console Data (Game Sales & Reviews)

Game information: 
- Name, platform, genre, developer, publisher, release year.
- Sales data: NA, Europe, Japan, and Other regions.
- User & critic reviews: Ratings & number of reviews.
- ESRB ratings: Audience appropriateness.
- Population Data (Market Size & Trends)

Population statistics (1995-2017) for different countries.
- Country Name: name of the country
- Country code: code of the country used in public data
- All other variables from 1995 to 2017: population of country in that year

### 2.2: Data Credibility and ROCCC Assessment

I will use ROCCC to assess whether this data has issues with bias or credibility.

- **Reliable**: Sales data is likely accurate, but critic & user reviews may contain bias or gaps. Population data is reliable if sourced from reputable databases.
- **Original**: The console data comes from a third-party source (likely a gaming database or review aggregator). The population data is from a public dataset (likely a government or UN source). The credibility depends on the reputation of these sources.
- **Comprehensive**: Game data is detailed (genre, platform, sales, reviews), but user demographics are missing. Population data lacks breakdowns like age groups or gaming habits.
- **Current**: No, the data is not current. Population data stops at 2017 (not fully up-to-date). Game data’s relevance depends on its last update—if recent, it’s useful; if outdated, trends may not align with 2025 market dynamics.
- **Cited**: Not explicitly mentioned. We need to verify the sources of the datasets.
